# HKU-Water-Dispenser-Distribution-Optimization

This mathematical modeling project aims at optimizing the distribution of water dispensers on HKU main campus by eventually suggesting addition and removal based on existing ones.

At a first-year undergraduate level, we devised the “Surrounding Elimination” method to analyze the collected data which is later fitted on the representative building floor maps. After comparing maps with different scaling methods, optimized suggestions were given on the addition and removal of existing water dispenser distributions. Moreover, we performed regression analysis to test the validity of the model assumptions based on the survey data.

This project was selected as one of three exemplar projects for the course SCNC1111 Scientific method and reasoning at the University of Hong Kong, which I also served as a senior tutor in the following academic year.
